  <title>Coding Conventions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      This appendix covers various aspects of programming style and coding conventions.
      It follows the conventions suggested in the Java \mbox{Language} Specification (<c>http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/</c>), which is summarized on Sun's Java Web site (<c>http://java.sun.com/docs/</c>).
      The conventions have been modified somewhat to fit the needs of an academic programming course.

      Coding conventions improve the readability and maintainability of the code.
      Because maintenance is often done by programmers who did not have a hand in designing or writing the original code,
      it is important that the code follow certain conventions.
      For a typical piece of commercial software,
      much more time and expense are invested in maintaining the code than in creating the code.
