    Simple statements, such as assignment statements,
    should be written one per line and should be aligned with the other statements in the block.
    Compound statements are those that contain other statements.
    Examples would include if statements,
    for statements, while statements, and do-while statements.
    Compound statements should use braces and appropriate indentation to highlight the statement's structure.
    Here are some examples of how to code several kinds of compound statements:

<pre>
if (condition) {        // A simple if statement
     statement1;
     statement2;
 } // if
 if (condition1) {       // An if-else statement
     statement1;
 } else if (condition2) {
     statement2;
     statement3;
 } else {
     statement4;
     statement5;
 } // if/else
for (initializer; entry-condition; updater) { // For loop
    statement1;
    statement2;} // for
while (condition) {          // While statement
    statement1;
    statement2;} // while
do {                        // Do-while statement
    statement1;
    statement2;} while (condition);
