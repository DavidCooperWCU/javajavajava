  <title>Preconditions and Postconditions</title>
  <p>
    A good way to design and document loops and methods is to specify their preconditions 
    and postconditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <em>precondition</em> is a condition that must be true before the method
    (or loop)
    starts.
  </p>
  <p>
    A <em>postcondition</em> is a condition that must be true after the method
    (or loop)
    completes.
    Although the conditions can be represented formally <mdash/> using boolean expressions <mdash/>
    this is not necessary.
    It suffices to give a clear and concise statement of the essential facts before and after the method
    (or loop).
  </p>
  <p>
    Chapter 6 introduces the use of preconditions and postconditions and 
    Chapters 6 through 8 provide numerous examples of how to use them.
    It may be helpful to reread some of those examples and model your 
    documentation after the examples shown there.
