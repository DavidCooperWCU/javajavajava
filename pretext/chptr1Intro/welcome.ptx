    Welcome to <em>Java, Java, Java</em>,
    a book that introduces you to object-oriented programming using the Java language.
    When considering the purpose of this text,
    three important questions might come to mind: 
   <ul>
    <li><p>Why study programming?</p></li>
    <li><p>Why study Java?</p></li>
    <li><p>What is object-oriented programming?</p></li>
   </ul>
    This chapter will address these questions.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we provide a brief introduction to computers and the Internet and World Wide Web (WWW).
    Then, we address why someone would study programming and we examine types of programming languages.
    We introduce the Java programming language and conclude 
    the chapter by exploring object-oriented programming principles and how Java is an object-oriented programming language.
