Description of files and subdirectories in the Labs directory.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains materials for laboratory exercises to support 
the third edition of  "Java, Java, Java! Object-Oriented Problem Solving." 
Unlike the first two editions, the description of the labs is not contained
in the text itself.  Modifications of most of the labs that appeared
in the first two editions of the text are also in this repository.  
The materials are organized by chapter with each chapter having at
least one lab and most early chapters having several different labs. 
There is a subdirectory for each chapter, named ch01, ch02, and so on.  
Within each chapter directory, there are separate subdirectories for 
each individual lab exercise. These are named descriptively -- e.g., 
timer, firstapplet, and so on.

The files in this directories.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

README.txt -- This file.

index.html  --Provides a complete listing in HTML format of all the 
               laboratory exercises contained in this directory. This 
               file allows the labs to be accessed using a Web browser.  
               The index is organized hierarchically and contains some 
               navigational links. The index lists a subdirectory name 
               for each lab exercise followed by links to documents
               in that subdirectory that support that lab.

Each lab is in a subdirectory that contains the following items:
---------------------------------------------------------------------

index.html -- A HTML file with a brief description of the lab with
               a link to the writeup for the lab exercise. Many of
               these web pages also contains an applet demo of
               a solution to the lab exercise.                 

writeup.html -- The write up for the lab. This HTML file can be
               used as is or can be downloaded and edited.  It can
               be used as web page instructions for the lab or can
               be printed out and used as hand-out lab instructions.

*.java      -- Some labs provide Java source files to students. These
               are either incomplete Java classes to be completed in 
               the lab or complete classes that are needed by students
               to interact with classes they are required to create.
