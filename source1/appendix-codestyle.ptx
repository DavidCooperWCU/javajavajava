<title>Coding Conventions</title>


<introduction>
<p>
This appendix covers various aspects of programming style and coding
conventions. It follows the conventions suggested in the Java \mbox{Language}
Specification (<c>http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/</c>), which is
summarized on Sun's Java Web site (<c>http://java.sun.com/docs/</c>).
The conventions have been modified somewhat to fit the needs of an
academic programming course. For further details see

Coding conventions improve the readability and maintainability of the
code. Because maintenance is often done by programmers who did not
have a hand in designing or writing the original code, it is important
that the code follow certain conventions. For a typical piece of
commercial software, much more time and expense are invested in
maintaining the code than in creating the code.
