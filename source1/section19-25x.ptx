<title>The Java Documentation Tool: <c>javadoc</c></title>
<p>
The <c>javadoc</c> tool parses the declarations and documentation
comments in a Java source file and generates a set of HTML pages that
describes the following elements: public and protected classes, inner
classes, interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.
</p>

<p>
The <c>javadoc</c> tool can be used on a single file or an entire package
of files. Recall that a Java documentation comment is one that begins
with <c>/**</c> and ends with <c>*/</c>. These are the comments that
are parsed by <c>javadoc</c>.
</p>

<p>
The <c>javadoc</c> tool has many features, and it is possible to use
Java <em>doclets</em> to customize your documentation. For full details
on using the tool, it is best to consult Sun's Web site. To illustrate
how it might be used, let's just look at a simple example.
</p>

<p>
The <c>FirstApplet</c> program from <xref ref="ch_intro2">Chapter</xref>
contains documentation comments. It was processed using the
following command:
</p>
<pre>
javadoc FirstApplet.java
</pre>
<p>
<c>javadoc</c> generated the following HTML documents:
</p>
<pre>
FirstApplet.html      -The main documentation file
allclasses-frame.html -Names and links to all the classes used in 
                       FirstApplet
overview-tree.html    -A tree showing FirstApplet's place 
                       in the class hierarchy
packages.html         -Details on the packages used in FirstApplet
index.html            -Top-level HTML document for 
                       FirstApplet documentation
index-all.html        -Summary of all methods and variables in
                       FirstApplet
</pre>
<p>
To see how the documentation appears, review the <c>FirstApplet.java</c>
source file and the documentation it generated. Both are available at
