<title>Declarations</title>
<p>
There are two kinds of declaration statements: field declarations,
which include a class's instance variables, and local variable
declarations.
<ul>
<li><p>Put one statement per line, possibly followed by an
end-of-line comment if the declaration needs explanation.</p></li>
<li><p>Initialize local variables when they are declared.  Instance
variables are given default initializations by Java.</p></li>
<li><p>Place variable declarations at the beginning of code blocks in which
they are used rather than interspersing them throughout the code
block.</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The following class definition illustrates these points:
</p>
<pre>
public class Example {
   private int size = 0;     // Window length and width
   private int area = 0;     // Window's current area

   public void myMethod() {
      int mouseX = 0;        // Beginning of method block

      if (condition) {
          int mouseY = 0;    // Beginning of if block
      ...
      } // if
   } // myMethod()} // Example
</pre>
