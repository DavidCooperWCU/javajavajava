Welcome to <em>Java, Java, Java</em>, a book that introduces you to
object-oriented programming using the Java language. When considering
the purpose of this text, three important questions might come to
mind: Why study programming? Why study Java? What is object-oriented
programming? This chapter will address these questions. First, we
provide a brief introduction to computers and the Internet and World
Wide Web (WWW). Then, we address why someone would study programming
and we examine types of programming languages. We introduce the Java
programming language and conclude the chapter by exploring
object-oriented programming principles and how Java is an
object-oriented programming language.
